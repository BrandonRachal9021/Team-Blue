2. Arrange: Create a tiny dataset of 4 records with the required numeric attributes age, bmi, children, charges
   Act: Call your function that calculates count, mean, std, min, 25th, 50th, 75th, max for each attribute (age, bmi, children, charges.)
   Verify the outputs exactly as numbers rounded here to 4 decimals. If every asserted value matches (within tolerance), the test passes.

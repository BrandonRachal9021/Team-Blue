2. Arrange: Create a tiny dataset of 4 records with the required numeric attributes age, bmi, children, charges
   Act: Call your function that calculates count, mean, std, min, 25th, 50th, 75th, max for each attribute (age, bmi, children, charges.)
   Verify the outputs exactly as numbers rounded here to 4 decimals. If every asserted value matches (within tolerance), the test passes.

Problem 1 Test:
//Arrange

var sex = ''
var direction = ''
var poilicy_holder = ''
int age = 0
int premuim_cost =  0
int bmi = 0 

//Act 

System.out.println(direction)

//Assert

if (direction == True) {
    System.out.println("Test was successful")
}
